# Layer Render
Just released "Layer Render" - a handy tool for #AutomationBlocksAe that lets you easily render out each layer in your comp as separate files. Save time and simplify your workflow!
Select your comps in project panel and run the “layer render” in Automation Blocks.  It will render each layers in selected comps and will place in folder based selected comp name. 
Also, you can customize each block, destination, name pattern, etc.
